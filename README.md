This repository contains the survey instrument, analysis scripts, and de-identified data for the NDSS '25 paper "The Kids Are All Right: Investigating the Susceptibility of Teens and Adults to YouTube Giveaway Scams" by Elijah Bouma-Sims, Lily Klucinec, Mandy Lanyon, Lorrie Faith Cranor, Julie Downs.

## Requirements
Analysis was performed using R version 4.3.3, however, it is not expected that the version of R would effect the results. The analysis script is distributed in the form of an R Markdown (.rmd) file, requiring [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to view.  Data is stored in Excel format (.xlsx), which requires Microsoft Excel or compatible spreadsheet software to view. Finally, the following readily available R packages are used in the analysis script: "dplyr", "rstatix", "readxl", "rcompanion", "DescTools",, and "stringr."
